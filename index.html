                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I'm an Army veteran from Texas who travels a lot, believes that only real holiday worth
                    celebrating is Holloween and who is changing career paths for the third time. After the army I
                    got a part time job bartending to supplement my income while I attended college but somehow
                    seven years later I found myself opening and managing my third bar in a place that I love to
                    hate, Panama City Beach and still no college degree in site. Luckily for me, I hated PCB enough to
                    quit, move back to Texas and finaly get that Finance degree. Then four years later I was not
                    doing what I thought I would be doing after graduating and had to admit to myself that I wasn't
                    happy doing that either. Right around that time I also found out that the guy with the Masters
                    Degree in Finance, me with my Bachlores Ddegree in Finance, and the lady with a High school
                    diploma were all doing the same job and getting paid the same amount but only one of us didn't
                    have college loans to pay off. That's when I realized that college degrees were overrated, and
                    that's how I ended up here.

                        <h1>Becoming A coder</h1>
                        <p> As a child I loved solving puzzles as a kid but somehow got out of the
                            habit of searching them out. Then one day I was working with n excel spread
                            sheat and started making my own formulas to make my life easier when I
                            realized I could solve puzzles and get paid for doing it. After a year of
                            attempting to shadow anyone in our coding department so I could make a
                            lateral career move when I was at Schwab but only getting excuses from my
                            supervisors I
                            knew I had to leave or I would never become a coder, In 10 short weeks I'll
                            be ready for you to hire me. Please see details below to connect.
